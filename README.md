## Description:

For our first project, we've created an application that displays recipes and the history of it. Our motivation for this project was our passion for food and cultures, therefore, we wanted to create an app that displays culinary diversity along with education about a plateâ€™s history and cultural significance. Also, a very common problem culinary enthusiasts face is variety, our application will display several dishes with different cultural backgrounds, flavors, and ingredients, making the user's experience more interesting. Finally, we learned a lot during this project; like fetching data from APIs, combining code correctly through GitHub, styling the page, and most importantly working together to reach a goal.

## User Story:

AS A food enthusiast,
I WANT to look for recipes that display the history behind it,
SO THAT I can learn about different dishes and cultures.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a recipe dashboard with search bar inputs,
WHEN I search for a recipe,
THEN I am presented with a dropdown of recipes from Tasty.com,
WHEN I select a recipe from the dropdown menu,
THEN I am presented with a front-page that displays the recipe, an image, and the history of the recipe. 
WHEN I select a recipe from the previously searched list,
THEN I am presented with a prompt that will notify me about auto-filling my search bar and take me to the top of the page
